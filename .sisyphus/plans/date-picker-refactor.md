# Plan: DatePicker Component Refactor

## TL;DR

> **Quick Summary**: Upgrade the existing Solid DatePicker component to match solid-ui's rich styling quality — range selection visuals, date state styling (today/selected/disabled), animation classes, and buttonVariants-based triggers — while preserving the project's tv + createMemo + splitProps conventions.
>
> **Deliverables**:
> - Enriched `packages/core/src/recipes/date-picker.ts` (tv slot styles)
> - Rewritten `packages/solid/src/date-picker.tsx` (reactive variants + buttonVariants)
>
> **Estimated Effort**: Quick (~30min)
> **Parallel Execution**: NO — sequential (2 tasks, second depends on first)
> **Critical Path**: Task 1 (recipe) → Task 2 (component)

## Context

### Original Request
User created a DatePicker solid component but feels it is "not as good as I want." They provided a solid-ui reference implementation with rich date state styling (range selection, today/selected/disabled visuals), animation classes, and buttonVariants-powered navigation triggers. They want to match that quality while keeping their existing tv variant conventions.

### Interview Summary
**Key Discussions**:
- Scoped import `@ark-ui/solid/date-picker` kept (matching Dialog, Select, etc.)
- Error variant support added (error prop → red borders on control/label)
- `buttonVariants` imported for PrevTrigger/NextTrigger (not inlining)
- No tests needed (no test infra in project)

**Research Findings**:
- All components follow: `splitProps` + `createMemo` + tv slot `{ class: local.class }`
- Button recipe exists at `packages/core/src/recipes/button.ts` with `variant`/`size` variants
- Existing `datePickerVariants` already has slots for all sub-components but missing rich data-attribute styling
- App.tsx already has a DatePicker demo section using all sub-components

### Metis Review
**Identified Gaps** (self-resolved):
- Error prop type: boolean (matches existing recipe defaultVariants)
- Range styling: Include all Ark UI built-in data attributes (`data-[range-start/end/in-range/outside-range]`, `data-[today/selected/disabled]`)
- Animation: Add CSS animation classes to content (matching solid-ui)
- Size prop: Not exposed (DatePicker is fixed-size)
- Locale/format: Handled by Ark UI internally
- Today/Clear button: Not in scope

---

## Work Objectives

### Core Objective
Upgrade DatePicker to solid-ui quality while preserving project conventions.

### Concrete Deliverables
- `packages/core/src/recipes/date-picker.ts` — enriched slot styles
- `packages/solid/src/date-picker.tsx` — rewritten with reactive variants + buttonVariants

### Definition of Done
- [x] `bun run build` passes in both packages
- [x] App.tsx DatePicker demo renders correctly with rich styling

### Must Have
- Table cells show range start/end/in-range visual distinction
- Table cell triggers show today/selected/disabled visual states
- Prev/Next triggers use buttonVariants outline styling
- Content has open/close animation classes
- error prop affects control + label styling
- All existing sub-components still exported from index

### Must NOT Have (Guardrails)
- No switch to `cn()` — keep tv slot pattern
- No new dependencies beyond existing tv/tailwind-variants/buttonVariants
- No test files
- No App.tsx demo changes (existing usage must still work)
- No new component exports beyond what's currently exported
- No RangePicker split
- No documentation changes

---

## Verification Strategy

> **ZERO HUMAN INTERVENTION** — ALL verification is agent-executed. No exceptions.

### Test Decision
- **Infrastructure exists**: NO
- **Automated tests**: NONE
- **Agent-Executed QA**: Build verification + browser inspection of App.tsx demo

### QA Policy
Every task MUST include agent-executed QA scenarios. Evidence saved to `.sisyphus/evidence/task-{N}-{scenario-slug}.{ext}`.

- **Build**: Run `bun run build` in both packages
- **UI Verification**: Use Playwright to navigate to the App.tsx demo page, interact with the DatePicker, and assert visual states

## TODOs

- [x] 1. Enrich datePickerVariants recipe

  **What to do**:
  - In `packages/core/src/recipes/date-picker.ts`:
  - Add rich data-attribute styling to `tableCell` slot:
    - `data-[range-start]:rounded-l-md`, `data-[range-end]:rounded-r-md`
    - `data-[in-range]:bg-accent`
    - `data-[outside-range][data-in-range]:bg-accent/50`
    - `first-of-type:data-[in-range]:rounded-l-md`, `last-of-type:data-[in-range]:rounded-r-md`
  - Replace `tableCellTrigger` with rich state styling:
    - `data-[today]:bg-accent data-[today]:text-accent-foreground`
    - `data-[selected]:bg-primary data-[selected]:text-primary-foreground`
    - `data-[disabled]:text-muted-foreground data-[disabled]:opacity-50`
    - `data-[outside-range]:text-muted-foreground data-[outside-range]:opacity-50`
    - `data-[outside-range][data-in-range]:bg-accent/50 data-[outside-range][data-in-range]:text-muted-foreground data-[outside-range][data-in-range]:opacity-30`
    - `data-[today][data-selected]:bg-primary data-[today][data-selected]:text-primary-foreground`
  - Update `content` slot to add animation classes from solid-ui:
    - `data-[state=open]:animate-in data-[state=closed]:animate-out`
    - `data-[state=closed]:fade-out-0 data-[state=open]:fade-in-0`
    - `data-[state=closed]:zoom-out-95 data-[state=open]:zoom-in-95`
  - Update `prevTrigger` and `nextTrigger` slots to use button-like styling matching `buttonVariants({ variant: "outline" })`:
    - `size-7 bg-transparent p-0 opacity-50 hover:opacity-100`
  - Update `viewControl` slot: `flex items-center justify-between gap-4`
  - Update `table` slot: ensure `w-full border-collapse space-y-1`
  - Update `tableRow` slot: `mt-2 flex w-full`
  - Update `rangeText` slot: ensure styling exists (currently it does)
  - Keep existing `error` variant and `defaultVariants`

  **Must NOT do**:
  - Do not remove any existing slots
  - Do not change the tv import pattern
  - Do not add cn() — use tv slot syntax only

  **Recommended Agent Profile**:
  - **Category**: `quick`
    - Reason: Single file update, known pattern (tv slot styling), no logic changes
  - **Skills**: `[]`
    - No specialized skills needed — pure tailwind class manipulation in tv slots

  **Parallelization**:
  - **Can Run In Parallel**: NO
  - **Blocks**: Task 2
  - **Blocked By**: None (can start immediately)

  **References**:
  - `packages/core/src/recipes/date-picker.ts:1-49` — Current recipe to modify
  - `packages/core/src/recipes/button.ts:1-28` — Reference for buttonVariants styling pattern
  - `packages/core/src/recipes/select.ts:1-31` — Reference for tv slot pattern with variants
  - User's solid-ui reference code (provided in request) — Source for rich data-attribute styling classes

  **Acceptance Criteria**:

  **QA Scenarios (MANDATORY)**:

  ```
  Scenario: Recipe builds successfully
    Tool: Bash

  Scenario: Recipe file is valid
    Tool: Bash
    Preconditions: Task 1 completed
    Steps:

      2. Verify error variant has true case for control + label
      3. Verify defaultVariants has error: false
    Expected Result: 22 slots present, error variant correct, defaultVariants correct

- [x] 2. Rewrite DatePicker solid component

  **What to do**:
  - In `packages/solid/src/date-picker.tsx`:
  - Import `buttonVariants` from `@ui/core` (add to existing imports)
  - Import `VariantProps` from `tailwind-variants` if needed (follow `button.tsx` pattern)
  - Make `styles` reactive: `const styles = createMemo(() => datePickerVariants({ error: !!local.error }))` for components that need error awareness
  - Components that DON'T need error: keep `const styles = datePickerVariants()` (static)
  - Update all components to use `styles().slot({ class: local.class })` pattern (with `styles()` call since it may be reactive)
  - For `DatePickerControl`: accept `error` prop (boolean), split it, use reactive styles
  - For `DatePickerInput`: accept `error` prop (boolean), split it, use reactive styles
  - For `DatePickerPrevTrigger` and `DatePickerNextTrigger`: use `buttonVariants({ variant: "outline" })` for base styling, merged via class override:
    ```tsx
    const prevTriggerClass = createMemo(() => styles.prevTrigger({ class: local.class }))
    ```
    The recipe slot already contains the button-like styling
  - Actually, import `buttonVariants` and use it:
    ```tsx
    import { buttonVariants } from '@ui/core'
    // In component:
    const btnClass = createMemo(() => buttonVariants({ variant: 'outline', class: styles.prevTrigger({ class: local.class }) }))
    ```
    Wait — that would double-apply. Better approach: have the recipe handle the button-like styling and just use the slot class directly. The recipe prevTrigger/nextTrigger slots already have button-styled classes. So keep the current pattern but with enriched classes from the recipe.

    Actually, looking at solid-ui more carefully, they use `buttonVariants` as a base and override with custom classes. In our pattern, the tv slot already contains all the classes. So we DON'T need to import buttonVariants in the component — the recipe slot classes replace the need for it. The recipe already has prevTrigger/nextTrigger styled like buttons.

    BUT the user explicitly chose "Import buttonVariants" in the question. So let me import it and compose:
    ```tsx
    import { buttonVariants } from '@ui/core'
    const prevTriggerClass = createMemo(() => buttonVariants({ variant: 'outline', class: styles().prevTrigger({ class: local.class }) }))
    ```

    Actually this creates a conflict — `buttonVariants` returns classes that might conflict with slot classes. The better approach: 
    ```tsx
    import { buttonVariants } from '@ui/core'
    // ... in component:
    const btnClass = createMemo(() => buttonVariants({ variant: 'outline', size: 'icon' }))
    const prevTriggerClass = createMemo(() => styles().prevTrigger({ class: `${btnClass()} ${local.class || ''}` }))
    ```

    Hmm that's getting complex. Let me think about this differently. The recipe prevTrigger/nextTrigger slots should NOT include the button base since buttonVariants provides it. Instead the component composes them together.

    Let me simplify: The recipe prevTrigger/nextTrigger slots will have just the custom overrides (like size-7, opacity-50, hover:opacity-100). The component will use buttonVariants as the base and override with slot classes.

    Actually the cleanest approach following our conventions: make the recipe slot minimal (just custom overrides) and use buttonVariants in the component as the base. This is similar to how solid-ui does it with cn() — but we use tv slot + buttonVariants.

    Let me use this approach:
    ```tsx
    const DatePickerPrevTrigger: Component<DatePickerPrimitive.PrevTriggerProps> = (props) => {
      const [local, others] = splitProps(props, ['class', 'children'])
      const styles = datePickerVariants()
      const prevTriggerClass = createMemo(() => 
        buttonVariants({ variant: 'outline', size: 'icon', class: styles().prevTrigger({ class: local.class }) })
      )
      // rest...
    }
    ```

    This composes: buttonVariants base (outline, icon) → tv slot overrides (custom sizing, opacity) → user class override.

    The recipe prevTrigger/nextTrigger slots should have only override classes (buttonVariants provides the base):
    - `prevTrigger`: `size-7 bg-transparent p-0 opacity-50 hover:opacity-100`
    - `nextTrigger`: `size-7 bg-transparent p-0 opacity-50 hover:opacity-100`
    Note: `[&>svg]:size-4` is already provided by buttonVariants' `[&_svg]:size-4`

  - Keep `children()` + `Show` pattern for Trigger, PrevTrigger, NextTrigger (with SVG fallbacks)
  - Keep same SVG icons (current lucide-style paths are fine)
  - Keep `DatePickerView` extracting `view` prop explicitly
  - Keep all exports the same

  **Must NOT do**:
  - Do not change export names
  - Do not remove any existing exports
  - Do not change to cn() — keep tv + createMemo pattern
  - Do not remove the children/SVG fallback pattern
  - Do not change App.tsx

  **Recommended Agent Profile**:
  - **Category**: `quick`
    - Reason: Single file rewrite, well-defined patterns, follows existing conventions exactly
  - **Skills**: `[]`
    - No specialized skills needed — follows existing component patterns

  **Parallelization**:
  - **Can Run In Parallel**: NO (depends on Task 1)
  - **Blocks**: Final Verification
  - **Blocked By**: Task 1

  **References**:
  - `packages/solid/src/date-picker.tsx:1-170` — Current file to rewrite
  - `packages/solid/src/button.tsx:1-19` — buttonVariants import and usage pattern
  - `packages/solid/src/select.tsx:8-14` — Reactive variant pattern (error prop + createMemo)
  - `packages/solid/src/select.tsx:16-19` — Static variant pattern (no error dependency, no createMemo needed)
  - `packages/solid/src/dialog.tsx:11-16` — Portal + Positioner pattern (for DatePickerContent)
  - `.agents/rules/solid/solid-component-variants-conventions.md` — Project conventions
